        "\n",
        "You'll notice that there are quite a few similarities between LangChain and LlamaIndex. LlamaIndex can largely be thought of as an extension to LangChain, in some ways - but they moved some of the language around. Let's spend a few moments disambiguating the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `QueryEngine` -> `LCEL Chain`:\n",
        "  -  `QueryEngine` is just LlamaIndex's way of indicating something is an LLM \"chain\" on top of a retrieval system\n",
        "- `OpenAIAgent` vs. `Agent`:\n",
        "  - The two agents have the same fundamental pattern: Decide which of a list of tools to use to answer a user's query.\n",
        "  - `OpenAIAgent` (LlamaIndex's primary agent) does not need to rely on an agent excecutor due to the fact that it is leveraging OpenAI's [functional api](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates) which allows the agent to interface \"directly\" with the tools instead of operating through an intermediary application process.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is, however, a much large terminological difference when it comes to discussing data.\n",

        "##### Nodes vs. Documents\n",
        "\n",
        "As you're aware of from the previous weeks assignments, there's an idea of `documents` in NLP which refers to text objects that exist within a corpus of documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "LlamaIndex takes this a step further and reclassifies `documents` as `nodes`. Confusingly, it refers to the `Source Document` as simply `Documents`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `Document` -> `node` structure is, almost exactly, equivalent to the `Source Document` -> `Document` structure found in LangChain - but the new terminology comes with some clarity about different structure-indices.\n",
        "\n",
        "We won't be leveraging those structured indicies today, but we will be leveraging a \"benefit\" of the `node` structure that exists as a default in LlamaIndex, which is the ability to quickly filter nodes based on their metadata.\n",
