# Week 7: Day 1 Session

In the following Notebook we will be exploring one of the most powerful techniques to take your single-domain RAG pipelines to the next level...

**Fine-tuning the Embeddings Model!**

In this notebook, we'll worth through the following tasks:

🤝 Breakout Room #1:
Dependencies and Boilerplate
Loading Data
Constructing a Fine-tuning Dataset
Fine-tuning snowflake-arctic-embed-m
Evaluating our Retriever
  
- 🤝 Breakout Room #2:
  - Part 1: LangSmith Evaluator:
    1. Creating an Evaluation Dataset
    2. Adding Evaluators
  - Part 2:
    3. Adding Helpfulness Check and "Loop" Limits
    4. LangGraph for the "Patterns" of GenAI
